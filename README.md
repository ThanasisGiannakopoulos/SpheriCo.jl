# SpheriCo.jl

SpheriCo.jl is package written in the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org/), developed and tested in version
1.10.0. It simulates the spherically symmetric collapse of a scalar field
in classical and semiclassical gravity.

For more information on installing and running SpheriCo.jl, please
see the [documentation](https://sphericojl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).

Videos from simulations made using the code can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyJ_PP8qOGF8pj5YvAKoQHOc9wp6fSUNk&si=82SbY7HFB6IBdRIW).
